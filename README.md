# BoilerHush

BoilerHush is a website designed to help students find the nearest study spots, and how busy they're currently busy and even allows for room bookings. Inspired by my own experiences of struggling to find a quiet place to study during final exams, I wanted to create a tool that would make this process easier for students.

Throughout development, I faced significant hurdles in integrating JavaScript with Python-Flask, establishing communication channels, and finding suitable APIs for free geocoding services. Overcoming these obstacles required a deep dive into AJAX requests, Flask's routing mechanisms, and the intricacies of asynchronous programming. Thanks to the invaluable support from communities like Stack Overflow and thorough documentation, I not only surmounted these challenges but also honed my skills in web development significantly.
